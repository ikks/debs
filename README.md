# Darling

[Darling](https://www.darlinghq.org/) can be called the wine for macOS in Linux, In releases you will find:

```
darling-debian-version-xxxxxxxx-.tar.gz
               here 12
                       hash from the commit on the darling repo
```
Why this? Because it takes around 14Gb of space to build the 100mb for darling and some hours to be 
[properly built](https://docs.darlinghq.org/build-instructions.html),
